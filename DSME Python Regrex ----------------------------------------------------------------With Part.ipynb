If some distance between the clamps and the journal fillets is provided, the loading is consistent with 4-point bending and thus representative for the journal fillets also. 4 In an engine, the crankpin fillets normally operate with an R -ratio slightly above -1 and the journal fillets slightly below -1. If found necessary, it is possible to introduce a mean load (deviate from 1 R =- ) by means of a spring preload. 5 A rig for torsion fatigue can also be arranged as shown in Fig. 7 . When a crank throw is subjected to torsion, the twist of the crankpin makes the journals move sideways. If one single crank throw is tested in a torsion resonance test rig, the journals with their clamped-on weights will vibrate heavily sideways. This sideway movement of the clamped-on weights can be reduced by having two crank throws, especially if the cranks are almost in the same direction. However, the journal in the middle will move more. 6 Since sideway movements can cause some bending stresses, the plain portions of the crankpins should also be provided with strain gauges arranged to measure any possible bending that could have an influence on the test results. 7 Similarly, to the bending case the applied load is to be verified by strain gauge measurements on plain shaft sections.

This can be based on the empirically determined SCF from 1.3 of Annex D2.3.1-2(2) if within its applicability range. 2 Bending and torsional stresses at the point of peak stresses are combined as in 1.6 of Annex D2.3.1-2(2) . 3 Fig. 4 indicates a local drop of the hardness in the transition zone between a hard and soft material. Whether this drop occurs depends also on the tempering temperature after quenching in the QT process. 4 The peak stress in the bore occurs at the end of the edge rounding. Within this zone the stress drops almost linearly to the centre of the pin. As can be seen from Fig. 4 , for shallow (A) and intermediate (B) hardening, the transition point practically coincides with the point of maximal stresses. For deep (C) hardening the transition point comes outside of the point of peak stress and the local stress can be assessed as a portion ( ) 12 / tH D of the peak stresses where tH is the hardening depth. 5 The subsurface transition-zone stresses (using the minimum hardening depth) can be determined by means of local stress concentration factors along an axis perpendicular to the oil bore surface.

Although the compressive residual stresses at the surface are high, the balancing tensile stresses in the core are moderate because of the shallow depth. 4 For the purpose of analysis of subsurface fatigue the disadvantage of tensile residual stresses in and below the transition zone may be even disregarded in view of this smooth contour of a nitriding hardness profile. 5 Although in principle the calculation should be carried out along the entire hardness profile, it can be limited to a simplified approach of examining the surface and an artificial transition point. (See Fig. 7 ) 6 This artificial transition point can be taken at the depth where the local hardness is approximately 20 HV above the core hardness.

The surface fatigue strength as determined by fatigue tests of full size cranks, may be used on an equal or similar design as the tested crankshaft when the fatigue initiation occurred at the surface. With the similar design, it is meant that a similar material type and surface hardness are used and the fillet radius and hardening depth are within approximately 30% of the tested crankshaft. 3 Fatigue initiation in the transition zone can be either subsurface, i.e. below the hard layer, or at the surface where the hardening ends. The fatigue strength at the transition to the core can be determined by fatigue tests as described above, provided that the fatigue initiation occurred at the transition to the core. Tests made with the core material only will not be representative since the tension residual stresses at the transition are lacking. 4 It has to be noted also what some recent research has shown: The fatigue limit can decrease in the very high cycle domain with subsurface crack initiation due to trapped hydrogen that accumulates through diffusion around some internal defect functioning as an initiation point. In these cases, it would be appropriate to reduce the fatigue limit by some percent per decade of cycles beyond 10$^{7}$.

If the bending fatigue strength is concluded to be % x above the fatigue strength of the non-peened material, the torsional fatigue strength should not be assumed to be more than 2/3 of % x above that of the non-peened material. 3 As a result of the stroke peening process the maximum of the compressive residual stress is found in the subsurface area. Therefore, depending on the fatigue testing load and the stress gradient, it is possible to have higher working stresses at the surface in comparison to the local fatigue strength of the surface. Because of this phenomenon small cracks may appear during the fatigue testing, which will not be able to propagate in further load cycles and/or with further slight increases of the testing load because of the profile of the compressive residual stress. Put simply, the high compressive residual stresses below the surface arrest small surface cracks. (See 2. in Fig. 8 ) 4 In fatigue testing with full-size crankshafts these small hairline cracks should not be considered to be the failure crack. The crack that is technically the fatigue crack leading to failure, and that therefore shuts off the test-bench, should be considered for determination of the failure load level. This also applies if induction-hardened fillets are stroke-peened. 5 In order to improve the fatigue strength of induction-hardened fillets it is possible to apply the stroke peening process in the crankshafts fillets after they have been induction-hardened and tempered to the required surface hardness. If this is done, it might be necessary to adapt the stroke peening force to the hardness of the surface layer and not to the tensile strength of the base material. 6 The effect on the fatigue strength of induction hardening and stroke peening the fillets is to be determined by a full-size crankshaft test.'}, {'id': '271', 'lang': 'en', 'edition': '2019', 'file_name': '410_part_d_e-cv_2019-334-490.pdf', 'class_name': 'nk', 'part_title': '', 'chapter_title': '', 'section_title': '6.1.', 'heading1': '6.1.3 Use of Existing Results for Similar Crankshafts', 'content': 'The increase in fatigue strength, which is achieved by applying stroke peening, may be utilized in another similar crankshaft if all of the following criteria are fulfilled: (1) Ball size relative to fillet radius within 10% in comparison to the tested crankshaft (2) At least the same circumferential extension of the stroke peening (3) Angular extension of the fillet contour relative to fillet radius within 15% in comparison to the tested crankshaft and located to cover the stress concentration during engine operation (4) Similar base material, e.g. alloyed quenched and tempered (5) Forward feed of ball of the same proportion of the radius (6) Force applied to ball proportional to base material hardness (if different) (7) Force applied to ball proportional to square of ball radius'}, {'id': '280', 'lang': 'en', 'edition': '2019', 'file_name': '410_part_d_e-cv_2019-334-490.pdf', 'class_name': 'nk', 'part_title': '', 'chapter_title': '', 'section_title': '2.2.', 'heading1': '2.2.1 Principal-stresses Criterion', 'content': 'The quality of the mesh is to be assured through checking of the stress component normal to the surface of the oil bore outlet radius.

Then, these values are multiplied by appropriate stress concentration factors (see 1.4 ) which results in equivalent alternating stresses (uni-axial stresses) (see 1.6 ). (4) Equivalent alternating stresses are evaluated in accordance with the following: (a) In fillets, bending and torsion lead to two different biaxial stress fields which can be represented by a Von Mises equivalent stress under additional assumptions that bending and torsion stresses are time phased and that corresponding peak values occur at the same locations. (b) At oil hole outlets, bending and torsion lead to two different stress fields which can be represented by equivalent principal stresses equal to the maximum of principal stresses resulting from combinations of these two stress fields under the assumption that bending and torsion are time phased.

(3) In the modified staircase method, the number of run-outs and failures are usually equal. However, the testing can be unsuccessful, e.g. the number of run-outs can be less than the number of failures if a specimen with 2 increments below the previous failure level goes directly to failure. On the other hand, if this unexpected premature failure occurs after a rather high number of cycles, it is possible to define the level below this as a run-out. (4) Dixon and Mood s approach, derived from the maximum likelihood theory, which also may be applied here, especially on tests with few samples, presented some simple approximate equations for calculating the sample mean and the standard deviation from the outcome of the staircase test.

Pitting is defined in the case of non surface hardened gears, the pitted area > 2% of total active flank area; in the case of surface hardened gears, the pitted area > 0.5 % of total active flank area, or > 4% of one particular tooth flank area. The Hlim s values are to correspond to a failure probability of 1% or less. The endurance limit mainly depends on: (1) Material composition, cleanliness and defects; (2) Mechanical properties; (3) Residual stresses; (4) Hardening process, depth of hardened zone, hardness gradient; (5) Material structure (forged, rolled bar, cast). Endurance limit for contact stress Hlim s is as given in Table 6.3-1. However, for materials having enough data showing their higher endurance limit, values larger than those given in the table may be allowed by the Society in consideration of factors (1) through (5) mentioned above. 3 Life Factor for Contact Stress, N Z The life factor for contact stress N Z accounts for the higher permissible contact stress in cases where a limited life (number of cycles) is required. Values larger than 1.0 are to be considered by the Society on a case by case basis. 4 Lubricant Factor, L Z Lubricant factor L Z like the speed factor V Z and roughness factor R Z accounts for the influence of the type of lubricant and its viscosity on surface endurance. These factors are to be determined for softer materials in cases where gear pairs are of different hardness. These factors mainly depend on: (1) Viscosity of lubricant in contact zones; (2) The sum of the instantaneous velocity of tooth surfaces; (3) Loads; (4) Relative radius of curvature at pitch points; (5) Surface roughness of teeth flanks; (6) Hardness of pinions and wheels.

For through hardened gears and for surface hardened gears with adequate case depth relative to tooth size and radius of relative curvature X Z = 1.0, in cases where the case depth is relatively shallow then a smaller value of X Z is to be taken. 9 Safety Factor for Contact Stress, The safety factor for contact stress H S is to be taken as follows: (1) In the case of main propulsion gears: 1.20 (2) In the case of auxiliary gears: 1.15 In cases where the gearing of duplicated independent propulsion or auxiliary machinery, has been duplicated beyond that what is required for its respective class, a reduced value may be taken at the discretion of the Society.'}, {'id': '310', 'lang': 'en', 'edition': '2019', 'file_name': '410_part_d_e-cv_2019-334-490.pdf', 'class_name': 'nk', 'part_title': '', 'chapter_title': '', 'section_title': '1.2.', 'heading1': '1.2.2 Bearings', 'content': '1 In cases where only one support point is assumed in aftmost stern tube bearings, its location is to be at L/4 or D/3 from the aft end of such bearings.

(2) Bending lengths are taken as the length between the two main bearing midpoints (distance L$_{3}$ , see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). (3) The bending moments BR M and BT M are calculated based on triangular bending moment diagrams due to the radial component R F and tangential component T F of the connecting rod force, respectively (see Fig. 1 ). (4) For those crankthrows with two connecting rods acting upon one crankpin, the relevant bending moments are obtained by superposition of the two triangular bending moment diagrams according to phase (see Fig. 2 ). (5) Bending moments and radial forces acting in webs (a) The bending moment BRF M and the radial force RF Q are taken as acting in the centre of solid webs (distance L$_{1}$ ) and are derived from the radial components of connecting rod forces. (b) Alternating bending and compressive stresses due to bending moments and radial forces are to be related to cross-sections of crank webs. These reference sections result from the web thickness W and the web width B (see Fig. 3 ). (c) Mean stresses are neglected. (6) Bending moments acting in outlets of crankpin oil bores (a) Two relevant bending moments are taken in crankpin cross-sections through oil bores and are derived from the radial and tangential components of connecting rod forces (see Fig. 4 ). (b) Any alternating stresses due to these bending moments are to be related to the cross-sections of axially bored crankpins. (c) Mean bending stresses are neglected. L$_{1}$ = Distance between main journal center line and crank web center (see also Fig. 3 for crankshafts without overlaps) L$_{2}$ = Distance between main journal center line and connecting rod center L$_{3}$ = Distance between two adjacent main journal center lines M BTO M is the bending moment of the tangential component of the connecting rod force. 2 Nominal Alternating Bending and Compressive Stresses (1) Calculation procedures are as follows: (a) Radial and tangential forces, due to gas and inertia loads, acting upon crankpins at connecting-rod positions will be calculated over one working cycle. (b) Using the forces calculated over one working cycle and taking into account of the distance from the main bearing midpoint, the time curve of the bending moments BRF M , BRO M , BTO M and radial forces RF Q , as defined in -1(5) and (6) , will then be calculated. (c) In case of Vee-type engines, bending moments, progressively calculated from gas and inertia forces, of the two cylinders, acting on one crankthrow, are superposed according to phase. Different designs (forked connecting rods, articulated-type connecting rods or adjacent connecting rods) are to be taken into account. (d) In cases where there are cranks of different geometrical configurations in one crankshaft, calculations are to cover all crank variants.

In such cases it is advised to either carry out also torsional testing or to make a conservative assessment of the torsional fatigue strength. This approach is applicable when using the Gough Pollard criterion. However, this approach is not recognised when using the von Mises or a multi-axial criterion such as Findley. 3 If the found ratio between bending and torsion fatigue differs significantly from 3 , one should consider replacing the use of the von Mises criterion with the Gough Pollard criterion. Also, if critical plane criteria are used, it has to be kept in mind that cgf makes the material inhomogeneous in terms of fatigue strength, meaning that the material parameters differ with the directions of the planes. 4 Any addition of influence factors is to be made with caution. If for example a certain addition for clean steel is documented, it may not necessarily be fully combined with a K -factor for cgf.

The analysis is to be conducted as linear elastic FE analysis, and unit loads of appropriate magnitude are to be applied for all load cases.

(2) These calculations are also based on the assumption that areas exposed to highest stresses are those that are listed below. In addition, attention is to be paid to prevent any excessive stress concentrations in outlets of journal oil bores. (a) Fillet transitions between crankpins and webs (b) Fillet transitions between journals and webs (c) Outlets of crankpin oil bores (3) Calculations of crankshaft strength require that nominal alternating bending (see 1.3.1 ) and nominal alternating torsional stresses (see 1.3.2 ) are determined first. Then, these values are multiplied by appropriate stress concentration factors (see 1.4 ) which results in equivalent alternating stresses (uni-axial stresses) (see 1.6 ). (4) Equivalent alternating stresses are evaluated in accordance with the following: (a) In fillets, bending and torsion lead to two different biaxial stress fields which can be represented by a Von Mises equivalent stress under additional assumptions that bending and torsion stresses are time phased and that corresponding peak values occur at the same locations. (b) At oil hole outlets, bending and torsion lead to two different stress fields which can be represented by equivalent principal stresses equal to the maximum of principal stresses resulting from combinations of these two stress fields under the assumption that bending and torsion are time phased. (5) Equivalent alternating stresses are then compared with the fatigue strengths of selected crankshaft materials (see 1.7 ). These comparisons will show whether or not those crankshafts concerned are dimensioned adequately (see 1.8 ).'},\n",

       "  'content': '1 Assumptions Calculations of alternating bending stresses are based on the following assumptions: (1) Calculations are based on statically determined systems, composed of a single crankthrow supported in the centre of adjacent main journals and subject to gas and inertia forces. (2) Bending lengths are taken as the length between the two main bearing midpoints (distance L$_{3}$ , see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). (3) The bending moments BR M and BT M are calculated based on triangular bending moment diagrams due to the radial component R F and tangential component T F of the connecting rod force, respectively (see Fig. 1 ). (4) For those crankthrows with two connecting rods acting upon one crankpin, the relevant bending moments are obtained by superposition of the two triangular bending moment diagrams according to phase (see Fig. 2 ). (5) Bending moments and radial forces acting in webs (a) The bending moment BRF M and the radial force RF Q are taken as acting in the centre of solid webs (distance L$_{1}$ ) and are derived from the radial components of connecting rod forces. (b) Alternating bending and compressive stresses due to bending moments and radial forces are to be related to cross-sections of crank webs. These reference sections result from the web thickness W and the web width B (see Fig. 3 ). (c) Mean stresses are neglected. (6) Bending moments acting in outlets of crankpin oil bores (a) Two relevant bending moments are taken in crankpin cross-sections through oil bores and are derived from the radial and tangential components of connecting rod forces (see Fig. 4 ). (b) Any alternating stresses due to these bending moments are to be related to the cross-sections of axially bored crankpins. (c) Mean bending stresses are neglected. L$_{1}$ = Distance between main journal center line and crank web center (see also Fig. 3 for crankshafts without overlaps) L$_{2}$ = Distance between main journal center line and connecting rod center L$_{3}$ = Distance between two adjacent main journal center lines M BTO M is the bending moment of the tangential component of the connecting rod force. 2 Nominal Alternating Bending and Compressive Stresses (1) Calculation procedures are as follows: (a) Radial and tangential forces, due to gas and inertia loads, acting upon crankpins at connecting-rod positions will be calculated over one working cycle. (b) Using the forces calculated over one working cycle and taking into account of the distance from the main bearing midpoint, the time curve of the bending moments BRF M , BRO M , BTO M and radial forces RF Q , as defined in -1(5) and (6) , will then be calculated. (c) In case of Vee-type engines, bending moments, progressively calculated from gas and inertia forces, of the two cylinders, acting on one crankthrow, are superposed according to phase. Different designs (forked connecting rods, articulated-type connecting rods or adjacent connecting rods) are to be taken into account. (d) In cases where there are cranks of different geometrical configurations in one crankshaft, calculations are to cover all crank variants.

The analytical method is based on empirical formulae developed from strain gauge measurements of various crank geometries and accordingly the application of these formulae is limited to those geometries. The SCF s calculated according to the rules of this Appendix are defined as the ratio of stresses calculated by FEM to nominal stresses in both journal and pin fillets. When used in connection with the present method in Annex D2.3.1-2(2) , von Mises stresses is to be calculated for bending and principal stresses for torsion. The procedure as well as evaluation guidelines are valid for both solid cranks and semi-built cranks (except journal fillets). The analysis is to be conducted as linear elastic FE analysis, and unit loads of appropriate magnitude are to be applied for all load cases. The calculation of SCF at the oil bores is covered by Appendix D4 . It is advised to check the element accuracy of the FE solver in use, e.g. by modeling a simple geometry and comparing the stresses obtained by FEM with the analytical solution for pure bending and torsion. Boundary Element Method (BEM) may be used instead of FEM.'},\n",

(2) Element type used in the vicinity of the fillets: (a) 10-node tetrahedral elements (b) 8-node hexahedral elements (c) 20-node hexahedral elements (3) Mesh properties in fillet radii applied to 90 degrees in a circumferential direction from the crank plane are as follows: (a) Maximum element size a through the entire fillet as well as in the circumferential direction is to be a = R$_{H}$ /4 in crankpin fillets and a = R$_{G}$ /4 in journal fillets. When using 20-node hexahedral elements, the element size in the circumferential direction may be extended up to 5 a . In the case of multi-radii fillet, the local fillet radius is to be applied. (b) Element size in fillet depth direction (see Fig. 1 ): i) First layer thickness equal to element size of a ii) Second layer thickness equal to element to size of 2 a iii) Third layer thickness equal to element to size of 3 a (4) A minimum of 6 elements are to be set across the web thickness. (5) The rest of the crank should be suitable for numeric stability of the solver. (6) Counterweights have to be modelled only when influencing the global stiffness of the crank significantly. (7) Modelling of oil drillings is not necessary as long as the influence on global stiffness is negligible and the proximity to the fillet is more than 2 R$_{H}$ or 2 R$_{G}$ (see Fig. 2 ) (8) Drillings and holes for weight reduction have to be modelled.

The standard deviation should be considered by taking the 90 % confidence into account. Subsequently the result to be used as the fatigue strength is then the mean fatigue strength minus one standard deviation. 4 If the evaluation aims to find a relationship between (static) mechanical properties and the fatigue strength, the relation is to be based on the real (measured) mechanical properties, not on the specified minimum properties. 5 The calculation technique in 2.1.4 was developed for the original staircase method.

(3) In the modified staircase method, the number of run-outs and failures are usually equal. However, the testing can be unsuccessful, e.g. the number of run-outs can be less than the number of failures if a specimen with 2 increments below the previous failure level goes directly to failure. On the other hand, if this unexpected premature failure occurs after a rather high number of cycles, it is possible to define the level below this as a run-out. (4) Dixon and Mood s approach, derived from the maximum likelihood theory, which also may be applied here, especially on tests with few samples, presented some simple approximate equations for calculating the sample mean and the standard deviation from the outcome of the staircase test.

       "  'content': '1 The fatigue strength achieved by specimen testing is to be converted to correspond to the full-size crankshaft fatigue strength with an appropriate method (size effect). 2 When using the bending fatigue properties from tests mentioned in 3.1 , it should be kept in mind that successful continuous grain flow (cgf) forging leading to elevated values compared to other (non cgf) forging, will normally not lead to a torsional fatigue strength improvement of the same magnitude. In such cases it is advised to either carry out also torsional testing or to make a conservative assessment of the torsional fatigue strength. This approach is applicable when using the Gough Pollard criterion. However, this approach is not recognised when using the von Mises or a multi-axial criterion such as Findley. 3 If the found ratio between bending and torsion fatigue differs significantly from 3 , one should consider replacing the use of the von Mises criterion with the Gough Pollard criterion. Also, if critical plane criteria are used, it has to be kept in mind that cgf makes the material inhomogeneous in terms of fatigue strength, meaning that the material parameters differ with the directions of the planes. 4 Any addition of influence factors is to be made with caution. If for example a certain addition for clean steel is documented, it may not necessarily be fully combined with a K -factor for cgf. Direct testing of samples from a clean and cgf forged crank is preferred.'},\n",

Fig. 6 shows a layout of the testing arrangement. 2 The applied load should be verified by strain gauge measurements on plain shaft sections. It is also pertinent to check fillet stresses with strain gauge chains. 3 Clamping around the journals is to be arranged in a way that prevents severe fretting which could lead to a failure under the edges of the clamps. If some distance between the clamps and the journal fillets is provided, the loading is consistent with 4-point bending and thus representative for the journal fillets also. 4 In an engine, the crankpin fillets normally operate with an R -ratio slightly above -1 and the journal fillets slightly below -1. If found necessary, it is possible to introduce a mean load (deviate from 1 R =- ) by means of a spring preload. 5 A rig for torsion fatigue can also be arranged as shown in Fig. 7 . When a crank throw is subjected to torsion, the twist of the crankpin makes the journals move sideways. If one single crank throw is tested in a torsion resonance test rig, the journals with their clamped-on weights will vibrate heavily sideways. This sideway movement of the clamped-on weights can be reduced by having two crank throws, especially if the cranks are almost in the same direction. However, the journal in the middle will move more. 6 Since sideway movements can cause some bending stresses, the plain portions of the crankpins should also be provided with strain gauges arranged to measure any possible bending that could have an influence on the test results. 7 Similarly, to the bending case the applied load is to be verified by strain gauge measurements on plain shaft sections.

The surface fatigue strength as determined by fatigue tests of full size cranks, may be used on an equal or similar design as the tested crankshaft when the fatigue initiation occurred at the surface. With the similar design, it is meant that a similar material type and surface hardness are used and the fillet radius and hardening depth are within approximately 30% of the tested crankshaft. 3 Fatigue initiation in the transition zone can be either subsurface, i.e. below the hard layer, or at the surface where the hardening ends. The fatigue strength at the transition to the core can be determined by fatigue tests as described above, provided that the fatigue initiation occurred at the transition to the core. Tests made with the core material only will not be representative since the tension residual stresses at the transition are lacking. 4 It has to be noted also what some recent research has shown: The fatigue limit can decrease in the very high cycle domain with subsurface crack initiation due to trapped hydrogen that accumulates through diffusion around some internal defect functioning as an initiation point. In these cases, it would be appropriate to reduce the fatigue limit by some percent per decade of cycles beyond 10$^{7}$. Based on a publication by Yukitaka Murakami Metal Fatigue: Effects of Small Defects and Non-metallic Inclusions the reduction is suggested to be 5 % per decade especially when the hydrogen content is considered to be high.'},\n",

This forms a weak spot and is important if it coincides with an area of high stresses. 7 Alternating and mean working stresses are to be known for the entire area of the stress concentration as well as to a depth of about 1.2 times the depth of the treatment.

(See Fig. 7 ) 6 This artificial transition point can be taken at the depth where the local hardness is approximately 20 HV above the core hardness.

Such testing is normally carried out as four-point bending, with a working stress ratio of 1 R =- . 3 From these results, the bending fatigue strength - surface - or subsurface-initiated depending on the manner of failure - can be determined and expressed as the representative fatigue strength for applied bending in the fillet. 4 In comparison to bending, the torsion fatigue strength in the fillet may differ considerably from the ratio 3 (utilized by the von Mises criterion). The forming-affected depth that is sufficient to prevent subsurface fatigue in bending, may still allow subsurface fatigue in torsion. Another possible reason for the difference in bending and torsion could be the extension of the highly stressed area. 5 The results obtained in a full-size crank test can be applied for another crank size provided that the base material (alloyed Q+T) is of the similar type and that the forming is done so as to obtain the similar level of compressive residual stresses at the surface as well as through the depth.

If the bending fatigue strength is concluded to be % x above the fatigue strength of the non-peened material, the torsional fatigue strength should not be assumed to be more than 2/3 of % x above that of the non-peened material. 3 As a result of the stroke peening process the maximum of the compressive residual stress is found in the subsurface area. Therefore, depending on the fatigue testing load and the stress gradient, it is possible to have higher working stresses at the surface in comparison to the local fatigue strength of the surface. Because of this phenomenon small cracks may appear during the fatigue testing, which will not be able to propagate in further load cycles and/or with further slight increases of the testing load because of the profile of the compressive residual stress. Put simply, the high compressive residual stresses below the surface arrest small surface cracks. (See 2. in Fig. 8 ) 4 In fatigue testing with full-size crankshafts these small hairline cracks should not be considered to be the failure crack. The crack that is technically the fatigue crack leading to failure, and that therefore shuts off the test-bench, should be considered for determination of the failure load level. This also applies if induction-hardened fillets are stroke-peened. 5 In order to improve the fatigue strength of induction-hardened fillets it is possible to apply the stroke peening process in the crankshafts fillets after they have been induction-hardened and tempered to the required surface hardness. If this is done, it might be necessary to adapt the stroke peening force to the hardness of the surface layer and not to the tensile strength of the base material. 6 The effect on the fatigue strength of induction hardening and stroke peening the fillets is to be determined by a full-size crankshaft test.'},\n",

The number of 3 × 10$^{6}$ cycles may be regarded as the beginning of the endurance limit. FE s is defined as unidirectional pulsating stress with a minimum stress zero (neglecting any residual stresses due to heat treatment). Other conditions such as alternating stress or prestressing etc. are covered by the design factor d Y . FE s values are to correspond to a failure probability of 1% or less. These endurance limits mainly depends on: (1) Material composition, cleanliness and defects; (2) Mechanical properties; (3) Residual stresses; (4) Hardening process, depth of hardened zone, hardness gradient (5) Material structure (forged rolled bar, cast) The value for FE s is to be calculated as follows: FE s 2 The values for Flim s are given in Table 7.3-1.

(2) These calculations are also based on the assumption that areas exposed to highest stresses are those that are listed below. In addition, attention is to be paid to prevent any excessive stress concentrations in outlets of journal oil bores. (a) Fillet transitions between crankpins and webs (b) Fillet transitions between journals and webs (c) Outlets of crankpin oil bores (3) Calculations of crankshaft strength require that nominal alternating bending (see 1.3.1 ) and nominal alternating torsional stresses (see 1.3.2 ) are determined first. Then, these values are multiplied by appropriate stress concentration factors (see 1.4 ) which results in equivalent alternating stresses (uni-axial stresses) (see 1.6 ). (4) Equivalent alternating stresses are evaluated in accordance with the following: (a) In fillets, bending and torsion lead to two different biaxial stress fields which can be represented by a Von Mises equivalent stress under additional assumptions that bending and torsion stresses are time phased and that corresponding peak values occur at the same locations. (b) At oil hole outlets, bending and torsion lead to two different stress fields which can be represented by equivalent principal stresses equal to the maximum of principal stresses resulting from combinations of these two stress fields under the assumption that bending and torsion are time phased. (5) Equivalent alternating stresses are then compared with the fatigue strengths of selected crankshaft materials (see 1.7 ). These comparisons will show whether or not those crankshafts concerned are dimensioned adequately (see 1.8 ).')\n",

(2) Bending lengths are taken as the length between the two main bearing midpoints (distance L$_{3}$ , see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). (3) The bending moments BR M and BT M are calculated based on triangular bending moment diagrams due to the radial component R F and tangential component T F of the connecting rod force, respectively (see Fig. 1 ). (4) For those crankthrows with two connecting rods acting upon one crankpin, the relevant bending moments are obtained by superposition of the two triangular bending moment diagrams according to phase (see Fig. 2 ). (5) Bending moments and radial forces acting in webs (a) The bending moment BRF M and the radial force RF Q are taken as acting in the centre of solid webs (distance L$_{1}$ ) and are derived from the radial components of connecting rod forces. (b) Alternating bending and compressive stresses due to bending moments and radial forces are to be related to cross-sections of crank webs. These reference sections result from the web thickness W and the web width B (see Fig. 3 ). (c) Mean stresses are neglected. (6) Bending moments acting in outlets of crankpin oil bores (a) Two relevant bending moments are taken in crankpin cross-sections through oil bores and are derived from the radial and tangential components of connecting rod forces (see Fig. 4 ). (b) Any alternating stresses due to these bending moments are to be related to the cross-sections of axially bored crankpins. (c) Mean bending stresses are neglected. L$_{1}$ = Distance between main journal center line and crank web center (see also Fig. 3 for crankshafts without overlaps) L$_{2}$ = Distance between main journal center line and connecting rod center L$_{3}$ = Distance between two adjacent main journal center lines M BTO M is the bending moment of the tangential component of the connecting rod force. 2 Nominal Alternating Bending and Compressive Stresses (1) Calculation procedures are as follows: (a) Radial and tangential forces, due to gas and inertia loads, acting upon crankpins at connecting-rod positions will be calculated over one working cycle. (b) Using the forces calculated over one working cycle and taking into account of the distance from the main bearing midpoint, the time curve of the bending moments BRF M , BRO M , BTO M and radial forces RF Q , as defined in -1(5) and (6) , will then be calculated. (c) In case of Vee-type engines, bending moments, progressively calculated from gas and inertia forces, of the two cylinders, acting on one crankthrow, are superposed according to phase. Different designs (forked connecting rods, articulated-type connecting rods or adjacent connecting rods) are to be taken into account. (d) In cases where there are cranks of different geometrical configurations in one crankshaft, calculations are to cover all crank variants.

Within this zone the stress drops almost linearly to the centre of the pin. As can be seen from Fig. 4 , for shallow (A) and intermediate (B) hardening, the transition point practically coincides with the point of maximal stresses. For deep (C) hardening the transition point comes outside of the point of peak stress and the local stress can be assessed as a portion ( ) 12 / tH D of the peak stresses where tH is the hardening depth. 5 The subsurface transition-zone stresses (using the minimum hardening depth) can be determined by means of local stress concentration factors along an axis perpendicular to the oil bore surface.

The forming-affected depth that is sufficient to prevent subsurface fatigue in bending, may still allow subsurface fatigue in torsion. Another possible reason for the difference in bending and torsion could be the extension of the highly stressed area. 5 The results obtained in a full-size crank test can be applied for another crank size provided that the base material (alloyed Q+T) is of the similar type and that the forming is done so as to obtain the similar level of compressive residual stresses at the surface as well as through the depth.

Therefore, depending on the fatigue testing load and the stress gradient, it is possible to have higher working stresses at the surface in comparison to the local fatigue strength of the surface. Because of this phenomenon small cracks may appear during the fatigue testing, which will not be able to propagate in further load cycles and/or with further slight increases of the testing load because of the profile of the compressive residual stress. Put simply, the high compressive residual stresses below the surface arrest small surface cracks. (See 2. in Fig. 8 ) 4 In fatigue testing with full-size crankshafts these small hairline cracks should not be considered to be the failure crack. The crack that is technically the fatigue crack leading to failure, and that therefore shuts off the test-bench, should be considered for determination of the failure load level. This also applies if induction-hardened fillets are stroke-peened. 5 In order to improve the fatigue strength of induction-hardened fillets it is possible to apply the stroke peening process in the crankshafts fillets after they have been induction-hardened and tempered to the required surface hardness. If this is done, it might be necessary to adapt the stroke peening force to the hardness of the surface layer and not to the tensile strength of the base material. 6 The effect on the fatigue strength of induction hardening and stroke peening the fillets is to be determined by a full-size crankshaft test.')\n",

This date and the construction numbers (i.e. hull numbers) of all the vessels included in the contract for construction of a series of vessels, including specified optional vessels for which the option is ultimately exercised, is the date on which the contract to build the series is signed between the prospective owner and the shipbuilder. For the purpose of this Procedural Requirement, vessels built under a single contract for construction are considered a series of vessels if they are built to the same approved plans for classification purposes. However, vessels within a series may have design If the alterations are subject to classification requirements, these alterations are to comply with the classification requirements in effect on the date on which the alterations are contracted between the prospective owner and the shipbuilder or, in the absence of the alteration contract, comply with the classification requirements in effect on the date on which the alterations The optional vessels will be considered part of the same series of vessels if the option is exercised not later than 1 year after the contract to build the series was signed.
